# React Router Dom Unexpected Behavior with 404 Route

This repository demonstrates an unexpected behavior in React Router Dom v6 when navigating to a route that doesn't exist.  The application renders the expected content for the defined routes, but navigating to undefined paths results in a blank page instead of rendering a 404 component.
